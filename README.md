# Segmentation-Modelling-to-predict-Median-Household-Income

Predicting median houseold income using Canada Census data through Segmentation Modelling.

The approach for analysis can be broken down into three broad components. 
Firstly, a clustering algorithm will be employed to group the communities based on common characteristics; the ‘Median Household Income’ variable will be dropped during this step to ensure that clustering  is  independent  of  wealth.  This  is  followed  by  applying  appropriate  modelling  tools  for prediction  and  interpretation  on  each  of  the  clusters  identified  in  the  first  step.  This  will  determine communities at need and identify where support can be provided. The final step will be to provide insights and inform decision making based on the results of the technical analysis.
